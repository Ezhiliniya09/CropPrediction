# 🌾 Crop Prediction Model

This repository contains a **Crop Prediction Model** that uses machine learning techniques to predict the most suitable crop to grow based on various environmental and soil parameters such as **nitrogen (N)**, **phosphorous (P)**, **potassium (K)**, **temperature**, **humidity**, **pH**, and **rainfall**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts the most suitable crop based on input features.
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms like **Random Forest** and **Decision Trees** for high accuracy.
- Provides a user-friendly interface to input data and get crop recommendations.
- Includes a complete dataset, preprocessing scripts, and a trained model.

## 🧪 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
**How to Run**
1.Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crop-prediction.git
cd crop-prediction
2.Run the prediction script:
python main.py
3. Run the web application:
cd app
python app.py
4.Access the web app at http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

📊 Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains information on soil and climate conditions along with the recommended crop. Features include:

N (Nitrogen)
P (Phosphorous)
K (Potassium)
Temperature
Humidity
pH
Rainfall

Model Performance
The model has been trained and evaluated using standard metrics:
Accuracy: ~95%
F1 Score: ~0.94
You can retrain or fine-tune the model by modifying the notebooks in the notebooks/ directory.
